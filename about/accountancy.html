<h1>About Readyfile (Accountancy Software)</h1>

<h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Our accountancy software is tailored towards accountancy firms,
    which currently supports bookkeeping functions, including
    extracting data from scanned invoices and bank statements, uploaded
    in bulk, deduplicating, and consilidation.
    <br><br>
    Whilst this is still a work in progress, with new features
    being developed, especially with Making Tax Digital,
    and with advancements in AI, it currently supports the invoice
    extraction.
