<h3>Development of Almonzo</h3>
<p>
    Almonzo began as a software for our founder's coursework for
    A Level Computer Science, and was first used in November 2023.
    Since the coursework submission, the software has been
    maintained by Readyfile, and undergone improvements, to make
    it better for our charities.
    <br><br>
    Oh - and if you are curious, the software gained 70 / 70 marks,
    after moderation, during the conferration of A Level results in
    2024.
