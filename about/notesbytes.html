<h1>About NotesBytes</h1>

<h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>
    NotesBytes is a way for students to trade study notes. This
    includes buying them at the list price, and selling them, with
    us only taking a 25 % commission. 
    <br><br>
    The website also contains notes made by our founder, Prem,
    during his studies, branded as NotesBytes notes. This includes
    some notes that have undergone refinement, such as the A Level
    Further Mathematics notes.

<h3>Development of NotesBytes</h3>
<p>
    Almonzo began as a software for our founder's project during
    the Coronavirus lockdowns, and was first released in February of
    2021. Since then, it has undergone improvements, with major improvement
    in the design being made in 2024.
